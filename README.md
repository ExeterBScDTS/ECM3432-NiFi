# ECM3432-NiFi

A collaborative investigation of Apache NiFi

## Getting started

### NiFi homepage

<https://nifi.apache.org/>

### Installation

<https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/getting-started.html>

Or maybe start at <https://nifi.apache.org/docs>

### Java

NiFi requires Java 11  (note this is not the latest Java version).

There are now several different builds of Java (not just Oracle).

There's a list at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial#_installing-a-java-development-kit-jdk

I used this one <https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk>

## First questions

* What is NiFi?

* How do I create a program in NiFi?

* What sorts of things can NiFi do?

* Can I extend NiFi?  If so, how?

## Suggested spikes

* Create a really short and simple guide to getting started with NiFi

* Create a cool demo

## Resources

NiFi is a visual programming language, so the easiest way to learn how to get started is from videos.
